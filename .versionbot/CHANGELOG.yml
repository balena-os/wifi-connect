      body: |
        The new UI does not handle properly duplicate network names and the form
        cannot be submitted because of errors. This patch filters out duplicate
        network names preserving the sort order by signal strength. Now both
        unnecessary duplicates in the network list are removed and the UI issue
        is resolved.

        WiFi Connect gets the NetworkManager service state through the systemd
        D-Bus API. If systemd is not active on the system, the application exits
        with error.

        Now it just prints an info message that the NetworkManager service
        cannot be retrieved.

        Following the work done in
        https://github.com/resin-io-modules/network-manager/issues/109, now
        error-chain error handling is introduced in WiFi Connect as well. This
        simplifies the error handling code and organizes it better.

        But most importantly when an error occurs the underlying causes are
        printed in a nicer way:

        ```

        $ ./wifi-connect -i notexisting

        Error: Cannot find network device with interface name 'notexisting'

        caused by: D-Bus failure:
        org.freedesktop.NetworkManager::GetDeviceByIpIface method call failed on
        /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager

        caused by: "No device found for the requested iface."

        $ echo $?

        10

        ```

        In the above case, the first error string is generated in WiFi Connect,
        the second one in our network-manager bindings, and the last third one
        in NetworkManager itself (sent using the D-Bus API). Additionally the
        line starting with `Error:` is colored in red in the terminal for better
        visibility.

        In comparison the previous version produced:

        ```

        $ ./wifi-connect -i notexisting

        [wifi_connect:ERROR] D-Bus
        'org.freedesktop.NetworkManager'::'GetDeviceByIpIface' method call
        failed on '/org/freedesktop/NetworkManager': No device found for the
        requested iface.

        $ echo $?

        0

        ```

        We now support exit codes for each kind of error defined in WiFi Connect
        as visible from the examples above.

        This is a major version update of WiFi Connect targeting support for
        multiple connection profiles. The previous version supported defining
        only a single connection profile through WiFi Connect, which limited
        moving the device between locations, etc.

        To support multiple connection profiles the application flow is now
        simplified and excludes unnecessary functionality:

        1. Trying to activate existing connections: this is handled by
        NetworkManager automatically.

        2. Deleting all existing wireless connections: this is out of WiFi
        Connect functionality scope and can be achieved in other ways if
        necessary.

        3. Not exiting the application if Internet connectivity is not
        established after connecting to the WiFi network. Now the application
        exits even if no Internet connectivity is established after connecting
        to the wireless network, as we should not make assumptions about the
        connectivity state of the network a user wants to connect to. Displaying
        the connectivity state on exit is kept though.

        Since this is a major release not compatible with v3 there was room for
        other improvements as well:

        1. Introducing `--activity-timeout` argument for exiting the application
        in case a user has not connected to the captive portal for the specified
        amount of time. The default is no activity timeout. This is needed in
        use cases where WiFi Connect can block the start shell script when
        Internet connectivity is temporary unavailable, e.g. Boombeastic does a
        google ping to determine whether to execute WiFi Connect and without
        this argument the main application will not start in case the device is
        restarted and there is temporary connectivity issue.

        2. The old `--timeout` argument which was about specifying amount of
        seconds to be waited for connection to be established is now removed.
        This was introduced in v3, but there was not a single case where this
        was really needed. In the future if such cases arise, we can introduce
        something similar again and implement it better.

        3. The directory containing the web UI assets of the application is
        renamed from `public` to `ui`.

        4. The example start script is renamed from `start` to
        `scripts/start.sh` and now it includes different example conditions for
        executing WiFi Connect before the application. The default condition is
        "Is there an active WiFi connection?" by checking the exit code of
        `iwgetid -r`. For this reason `wireless-tools` is installed in the
        Dockerfile.template.

        5. Installation instructions section in the README including installing
        on Raspbian/Debian Stretch.

        6. WiFi Connect logo and a new How It Works image.

        7. The code in network.rs is refactored for reducing the cyclomatic
        complexity.

        Using this tag avoids issues with non-existent device images. This can
        happen if a new devices gets support in resin and at the time node
        version has advanced, so old docker images don't exist.
        Fixes #38
